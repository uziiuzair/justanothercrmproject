# Just Another CRM Project

Just Another CRM Project or jaCRM started of as a small time side project which was meant to distract me from an existing project I was working on. It was meant to only be done in 15 days from February 13 to 28, 2019. However as I worked on it, it became more than a small time experiment to something I have dedicated a lot of hours to. 

jaCRM is meant to be a Small Business CRM. Everything in the CRM is researched upon, from Design to Functionality. While the system is expected to work for everyone, my primary market while working on the system was Creative Agencies. I had the priviledge to talk to several leading agencies while working on this CRM, I was able to research their needs and how they communicated with their clients.

I hope you like the CRM.
