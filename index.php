# Dear Reader,
# Thank you for attempting to read this code.
# I hope you enjoy your journey in with this awful and non-extendable code.
# I wish you the best of luck trying to modify stuff without breaking anything 
# and I hope you don't end up tearing your hair off.
# 
# This has been a fun experiment to work on, and certainly my first full-scale 
# web application. You could probably already tell.
# 
# If you have any questions, feel free to reach out if you have any questions 
# the platform. I promise, Version 2 would be a lot cleaner and more extendible.
# 
# Cheers,
# Uzair.
